                beach, and it is extremely harmful to the sea life. 
                This needs to be cleaned up by taking in and putting 
                it in garbage bags, and then disposing of the trash 
                in the right way. Some garbage may need to be picked 
                up in the water, but the majority of it is on land.

              <div class="event_words"><p>Charlestown - Fellowship Park<br/>Studies show that approximately 66 and 
                2/3% of playgrounds in PA are contaminated with 
                pollution and not maintained daily. About 50% of those 
                are visited roughly 25% less than the other 33 and 1/3%. 
                15% of the 25% of park-goers estimate that, given 40% more 
                time, 70% of the pollution will increase by up to 7%. 
                The remaining 85% of citizens who attend parks claim to 
                see 17% more trash than 13% of the other 15%. With some 
                simple math, you can find that the 85% plus the 25% of 
                people plus the 15% of park-goers find that 70% plus 66 
                and 2/3% of parks plus 25% have 83% of trash divided by 
                the remaining 17% of pollution. In conclusion, 125% of 
                people see about 4.88% of pollution at 161 and 2/3 of 
                parks in PA. This park is a clear example of this, 
                and we must do something about it!

                for the pollution in the oceans, there is no need for 
                human interaction to clean it up. With the recent 
                discovery of a turtle with over 40 separate pieces of 
                plastic in its stomach, researchers estimate that 
                within the next 20 years, these turtles will have 
                every ocean completely clean! (Besides, plastic 
                straws are a necessary part of a turtle's diet!)

                and I saw this turtle struggling to stay alive. When 
                I saw that he was about to die, and the only thing 
                that could save him is if someone were to help him, 
                my first reaction was to take a bunch of pictures 
                and post them on social media. The turtle is dead 
                now. Please help!
