              <p class="home_text">This project is designed to be a 
                meeting point for anyone interested in getting 
                involved in cleaning up this earth. Anyone here is 
                able to contribute or help out in some way. Even the 
                slightest action done in the direction of making 
                Pennsylvania a cleaner place is greatly appreciated. 
                The small changes that may be done such as picking 
                up a single peice of trash are things that one might 
                thing would not impact much at all. However, for 
                each peice of garbage that is picked up, it makes 
                someone else's job easier. Making other's lives 
                better is what cleaning up pollution is all about. 
                Pollution rarely ever harms the person that does it, 
                because it is future generations that are affected 
                from it. If you would like to hear more details about 
                our project, be sure to check out the <em>About Us</em> 
                section of this website.

                can find different ways to get in contact with other 
                people interested in the same cause. You can help out 
                in this cause in multiple ways, and even get small 
                rewards for your efforts. Check out all of the different

              <p class="home_text">This shows a map that has several 
                areas that are polluted marked out on it. These areas 
                are color coded and can be identified by someone 
                interested in cleaning the area. A person could then 
                make and <em>event</em> out of that area, and you could 
                find that event on the <em>Events</em> page.
              </p><br/><p class="home_text">On the same page, you are 
                also able to report a polluted area. These reports will 
                be reviewed and then added to the map for others to see. 
                Anyone is welcome and able to contribute in this way. 
                Of course, the reports will be reviewed to make sure the 
                report is valid and is of significance.

                purpose of notifying the community about current 
                events. The majority of the messages will be about 
                general news about the community as a whole. These 
                messages ideally should be uplifting to the people 
                of the community and inspire. They can help with 
                boosting morale and generating initiative to work 
                for a good cause. 
              </p><br/><p class="home_text">Occasionally, there may 
                also be a news article about a large event. This could 
                either serve the same purpose as the other news 
                articles, but they may also be used to emphasize 
                the importance of an event and help advertize a large 
                event better.

                with a small reward that can be used on the 
                <em>Rewards</em> page. Anyone is able to join events,
