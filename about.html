          <p class="about_subt">Pillars of our Organization</p><br/>
          <p class="about_text">This is a community website for anyone 
            across Pennsylvania to help clean up. Pennsylvania, along 
            with the majority of this earth, has some pollution. We 
            aim to help people realize that changing this even the 
            slightest bit can prevent us from suffering more in the 
            future. The truth is that the majority of pollution can 
            easily be prevented with little to no extra work.
          </p><br/><p class="about_text">An ideal goal of ours 
            is to stop the source of pollution. This is something 
            that will not end up being very successful since some 
            person along the line will be careless and ruin the hard 
            work of others. Although this is something that may not 
            be very likely to be accomplished, we believe it is an 
            effort that every person should strive to contribute to. 
            It is always better to put in some work to possibly help 
            than to not give any effort and hurt other's progress.
          </p><br/><p class="about_text">The main thing that we focus 
            on is picking up the small things that we can control. A 
            very common misconception about us that is formed mainly 
            with our organization claiming to deal with pollution is 
            that we deal with air pollution. This is <em>not</em> true. 
            We do not deal with air pollution. We instead deal with 
            land pollution and sometimes water pollution. This is 
            because these things are much more managable and easily 
            fixable by the average citizen. We hope to get our point 
            across when we say that every little bit of help in 
            preventing pollution can add up and change the world 
            around us.

          <p class="about_subt">Our Goals</p><br/>
          <p class="about_text">To put it simply: Our two main goals 
            with the creation of this organization are to provide 
            <i><u>Organization</u></i> and <i><u>Initiative</u></i>.
          </p><br/><p class="about_text2"><u>Organization</u>
          </p><p class="about_text">Our website and app are designed 
            so that the user is able to connect with the community to 
            fight littering and pollution. Pollution and littering 
            are problems that everyone has, so we created a way that 
            people could unite to help each other through their 
            problems. People are able to have their griefs heard and 
            met by other community members. Our system may even 
            eventually serve as a network tying together other 
            organizations and groups. This site is intended to be a 
            convening point for everyone in Pennsylvania who has the 
            want to help the environment through decreasing pollution.
          </p><br/><p class="about_text2"><u>Initiative</u>
          </p><p class="about_text">The work that needs to be done is 
            honestly not very hard work. Anyone could do it. The 
            problem is that no one <em>wants</em> to do it. We hope 
            that this system that we have created can call forth a 
            sense of urgency about the matter at hand. People will 
            notice how much others care and what they are doing about 
            pollution. We even integrated a reward system where people 
            could earn several small prizes for their work that they 
            do. We did not quite intend for this reward system to be 
            the primary source of initiative, but we hope that people 
            will see how giving can also give back.

          <p class="about_text">This group worked well together in 
            order to form something that would go outside the 
            boundaries of what we consider an ordinary call to action: 
            to create something that eventually could unite so many 
            with a cause to preserve our future.
