          <div class="news_text"><p>This just in - Pennsylvania's "Pen 
            Pollution Project" (PPP) is rapidly growing in popularity 
            among PA residents of all ages, and the trends show that it 
            probably is not going to slow down any time soon! This may 
            have to do with one other significant factor, that at first 
            glance may seem unrelated. As the PPP sweeps the nation, 
            the new ideology regarding "Taco Tuesday" grows in 
            correspondence. Coincidence? I have interviewed a random 
            local who claims to regularly participate in both. Ryan 
            (DaPieGuy) Pie explains, "This is no coincidence, lemme 
            tell ya! As people buy tacos on Taco Tuesday, I have found 
            that people always throw their taco wrappers on the ground, 
            to then immediately report them and pick them up. Are we 
            scamming the government? The way I see it, yes. Those bozos 
            at Washington never saw it coming!"</p></div>

          <div class="news_text"><p>This just in - These people are 
            picking up trash! They all have smiles on their face and 
            are super happy to pick up garbage. If you wear a green 
            shirt with a recycle sign on it, and pick up a bunch of 
            garbage off the ground, then you can be as happy as these 
            people! It's great how these people totally and completely 
            understand the significance of cleaning up pollution on 
            this earth. The see how in 30 years the earth may have 
            irreversible scars from the effects of pollution. They see 
            how irreverent and careless the human race is and how we 
            end up destroying everything we love in this world. 
            Thousands, if not millions of happy animals are being 
            plagued by this garbage that we willingly put into their 
            homes. We, as a collective people, are murderers of 
            happiness for so many beings all around this earth as a 
            result of our careless waste. But, these people fully 
            understand how truly sad these facts are, and they still 
            have a smile on their face while they pose for this picture 
            so that they can appear that they care. They then posted 
            this image on all sorts of media to try to satisfy the 
            general population by convincing them that they care about 
            this planet. Therefore, since there are no riots happening, 
            and no one is aware of and upset at the fact that we are a 
            cruel race that does not care about others, then it must be 
            okay! What a great attitude to have! :)</p></div>

          <div class="news_text"><p>This just in - Minecraft, a beloved 
            game of this century, has had a recent, unfortunate downfall 
            due to all of its servers being fully contaminated with 
            pollution. However, Mojang has just announced the new, 
            improved, and clean version of Minecraft - one with only 
            circles. It has been publicized that every currently-existing 
            Minecraft world will be completely deleted in exactly 30 
            seconds. Luckily, it only takes 1 minute to transfer your 
            world to circles; so you'd better hurry, before it's gone!</p></div>
